# Module-5-challenge---Pymaceuticals

In this challenge I have done the following -
- Merged two data sets into one dataframe and cleaned the dataframe from mouse id's with duplicate timepoints
- I've generated a summary statistics table for each drug regimen and calculated the mean, median, variance, standard deviation and SEM of the tumor
- I've created bar charts and pie charts using pandas and matplotlib
- I calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse across four regimens - Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and ceftamin
- I then calculated the quartiles and IQR to determine if there were any potential outliers
- I determined the outliers using upper and lower bounds
- I chose mouse ID s185 to generate a line plot of tumor volume versus time point for that mouse
- I generated a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.
- I calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.
- I plotted the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
